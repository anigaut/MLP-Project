# IITM BS: Machine Learning Project

This repository contains the notebook I submitted for the Machine Learning Project course of IIT Madras' BS program. The project was based on a dataset that captures criminal actvity in a city and students had to create Machine Learning Models that would accurately predict the category of crimes committed based on various aspects of each incident such as including date, time, location, victim demographics, and more.

The training data, to which the models are fitted is in `train.csv` . The labels are in the `Crime_Category` column of the same. The test data, meanwhile is in `test.csv`. The `sample.csv` is an example file for the format in which the submission is to be made. `notebook.ipynb` contains the code I wrote to work with the given data and build ML models on them.
